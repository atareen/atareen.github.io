## This page is under development

I am a joint computational postdoc and software developer in bio-physics at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 
I am interested in using machine learning methods to understand sequence-function relationships in massively parallel assays. 
I am also interested in developing methods that help interpret the black-box nature of neural networks.
